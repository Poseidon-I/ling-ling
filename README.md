+ Permitted Use of Code

```diff
- Unpermitted Uses of Code
```
- All other copying of code is banned and can lead to a ticket opened against you on Discord as well as a permanent bot and server ban.
- You may not look thorugh the code soley to find and abuse/exploit bugs/vulnerabilities.  This will warrant, at minimum, a save reset.

Note: Not every single update is uploaded, and minor versions will often be skipped over.  Do not report any bugs that have already been marked fixed in the update log.
