+ Permitted Uses of Code
```
- You may take portions of code (up to ~5 lines per file) to use in your own project.
- You may use more than 5 lines if you have permission.  You can obtain permission by DMing me `Stradivarius Violin#6156` with the reason for use and what you are using it for.
- You may post `Luthier.java` if your server members have trouble figuring out the words.
- You may look through the code to find bugs to report, finding enough bugs might just get you rewarded :)

```diff
- Unpermitted Uses of Code
```
- You may not use more than one file per project for your own purposes.
- You may not look thorugh the code soley to find and abuse bugs.

**Using any code in unpermitted ways will earn you a permanent bot and server ban, and possibly action taken against you by Discord depending on severity.**
